        "Changing it via an instance creates a new instance variable (instead of modifying the class variable).\n",
        "\n",
        "2️⃣ Instance Variable\n",
        "\n",
        "An instance variable is unique to each object (instance) of a class. It is defined inside the constructor (__init__ method) and belongs to the specific instance.\n",
